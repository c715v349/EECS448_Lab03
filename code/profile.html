	<p class = "biography"><b><u>Who is this?:</b></u><br>My nickname is Sneeze, and I'm a cat. In my profile picture to the left, you can see by my posters in the background that I'm a fan of Spiderman and Nintendo, especially the Mario series. I also collect action figures and jewelry (that's a jewelry box on my second shelf). On the wall to the right, you can see my PhD for Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, and to the right of that, my calendar. I like keeping things organized. I'm a humble and interesting cat, interested in making new friends. PM me if you're interested in knowing more.</p>
